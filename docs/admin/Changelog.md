### Improvements

## Release notes - CCX - v1.40.0. - 26th of June

### Features

- Ability to resize the volume of a datastore node upon customer request CCX-937
  Limitations: due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2003816 we recommend you update images to Ubuntu 22.04.6. There is a regression in resizefs.
- A Terraform provider that is working and up-to-date CCX-2995
- - https://github.com/severalnines/terraform-provider-ccx/releases/tag/v0.2.3
- - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/severalnines/ccx/latest
- One bucket per datastore #163

### Improvement

- Redesign the configuration selection in the Deployment wizard.
- Update/manage existing security groups #219
- Update CMON and CCUI v2
- CCX User UI, allow user to choose AZ for the services #104
- Node scaling , scale with 2 nodes for Galera. #160
- CCX UI: allow user to choose AZ when creating a new datastore node CCX-2894
- Upgraded NATS to Jetstream as NATS is deprecated.

### Bugs

- CCX UI: Create datastore, possible to add duplicate tags #191
- Postgres: Created database could only have ccxadmin as owner. Now the user can select database owner.
- Inform user about failed datastore deployment reason when it is quota exceeded error
- CCX spams the logs - added debug flag
- Insufficient privileges: Percona/MySQL add WITH GRANT OPTION

### CMON improvements/fixes in 1.9.8-6397

- Fixed a bug where auto recovery was disabled following a restore database
- MySQL/MariaDb: For small configuration (4GB RAM or less), the innodb_buffer_pool_size is set to 25% (was 50% before).
- MySQL/MariaDb: Fixed a bug in database sizes (as presented in the UI)

### Current limitations / Known issues.

- Scale storage (this is being worked on now)
- - Node information is not being updated after storage extension, the user needs to refresh to see the proper state:
- - When the user makes scale nodes/extend storage action, then there is a few seconds delay before buttons are disabled. Can we make /a job request right after the Save button is clicked?
- - Unify naming Replica and secondary.
- - After adding multiple node actions or deleting node actions then the scale nodes modal shows the not updated state. Even page refreshing is not fixing this state.
- - Due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2003816 we recommend you update images to Ubuntu 22.04.6. There is a regression in resizefs.
