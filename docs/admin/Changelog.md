- **New UI for Selecting Instances**  
  Improves the process of choosing instance types in the deployment workflow.

- **Improved CCX Admin UI Delete Confirmation**  
  Enhances delete dialogs to include identifying datastore information, reducing the risk of accidental deletions.

- **Backup Source Selection (Primary or Replica)**  
  Lets users choose whether backups run on the primary node or a replica for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.

- **Configurable Pricing in YAML**  
  Allows prices or cost-related configurations to be defined in YAML instead of relying on external references.

- **Extended Event Log for “Enabling Read Only” Job**  
  Captures and displays why nodes were put in read-only mode, including disk space threshold messages.

- **Keycloak API Integration (PoC)**  
  Begins integration of Keycloak for user and realm management, laying groundwork for external authentication.

- **Switch to `pgx` Driver for PostgreSQL**  
  Uses the `pgx` library to support `target_session_attrs=read-write`, helping detect read-only nodes more reliably.

- **Multi-AZ (Multiple Availability Zones) Support**  
  Offers the ability to deploy nodes across multiple zones for greater resilience.

- **Terraform Provider Enhancements**  
  - Supports creating and assigning parameter groups.

  - Various bug fixes around node sizing, maintenance hours, and datastore destruction.

- **Return Backup Metrics in Usage/Billing**  
  Exposes backup counts and sizes along with other usage metrics.

- **TLS for Exporters**  
  Enables secure connections for database/exporter metrics using HTTPS endpoints.

  Integrates privacy-conscious analytics to track user signups and measure engagement without exposing personal data.

- **`net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter` = 0 for MSSQL**

- **Use Cluster UUID for VM Naming**  
  Prefers cluster UUID instead of node UUID in CloudStack (and similar) to standardize VM names.

- **“Cache22” Replaces “Redis” Branding**  
  Removes references and logos of Redis to comply with legal requirements, adopting an internal “Cache22” brand.

- **Exponential Backoff in Repair Jobs**  
  Applies a retry strategy with increasing wait times for certain automated cluster repair operations.

### Tasks

- **Rework S3 Credentials for Backups**  
  Consolidates multiple S3 credentials into a single or region-based credential in most deployments.

  Renames the service to a simpler “datastores” component in the codebase and directory structure.

- **Nodes List & Scale Modals**  
  Implements “Nodes list,” “Scale nodes,” and “Scale volume” modals for more transparent cluster scaling.

- **Upgrade Procedure v2**  
  Revisits the auto-upgrade flow, moving away from scheduling upgrades via manual timestamps.

- **Cleanup of `db_parameter_tests`**  
  Removes obsolete or duplicated tests, consolidating parameter checks.


### Bugs

- **Invalid DB Parameter Acceptance**  
  Fixed an issue allowing invalid DB parameters to be saved, causing cluster errors.

- **Missing Validation for Backup Retention**  
  The UI now properly enforces valid backup retention periods.

- **Occasional State Worker Panic**  
  Addressed a nil-pointer dereference in the state worker leading to random panics.

- **Disk Resize Email Formatting**  
  Corrected alerts that incorrectly showed “resized from 50GB to 50GB” even when the size changed.

- **Double-Promote Node in MSSQL**  
  Prevented duplicate “promote node” jobs from running when changing volumes on MSSQL AlwaysOn clusters.

- **Ephemeral Volume Change Validation**  
  Added checks to forbid switching from “ephemeral” to a standard volume type after deployment (and vice versa) when unsupported.

- **Panic on Backup Schedules (`makeslice: cap out of range`)**  
  Resolved an overflow bug when reading certain schedule data from CMON.

- **Terraform Cannot Destroy Failed Datastores**  
  Fixed internal references so a datastore that failed during creation can still be destroyed via Terraform.

- **Maintenance Window Shifting in Terraform**  
  Corrected an issue where updating the node count in Terraform also changed maintenance hours unexpectedly.

- **Random Datastore Ordering**  
  Ensured the datastore list is sorted (by creation time) rather than appearing in random order.

- **Datastore “Unknown” or “Unreachable” During Deployment**  
  Improved status transitions to remain in “Deploying” until fully validated.

- **Flag Icons Scrambled on Delete**  
  Refresh logic now correctly updates flags and icons after deleting a datastore from the list.

- **Duplicate DB Parameter Group Names**  
  Added both frontend and backend checks to prevent accidental name collisions.

- **Cannot Delete DB Parameter Group if Datastore is Deleting**  
  Allowed parameter group removal if all associated datastores are already in “deleting” state.

- **Wizard Crash on Cloud Switch**  
  Fixed a UI crash when switching cloud providers mid-wizard.

- **Scaling Redis Nodes in GCP**  
  Addressed rate-limit and context-cancellation issues when adding multiple nodes quickly.

- **No Reboot Indicator in Datastore Overview**  
  The UI now shows an in-progress job status during a node reboot operation.

- **Redis Primary Reboot Failure**  
  Revised the logic that previously rejected reboot jobs on a node hosting multiple processes.

- **KubeVirt AddNode Memory Passing**  
  Ensured memory sizing is properly included when adding KubeVirt nodes.

- **Redis Data Volume Size Mismatch**  
  Corrected an error that assigned incorrect sizes to Redis volumes.

- **Region and CSP Misalignment**  
  Standardized the layout so cloud region info aligns properly in the UI.

- **Creating DB Parameter Group Fails for MariaDB/MySQL**  
  Fixed improper validation of `require_secure_transport` for these vendors.

- **Empty Volume Code Validation**  
  Prevented invalid volume code “blank” entries during cluster creation.

- **MSSQL AlwaysOn Node Config Not Preselected**  
  The recommended multi-node setting is now auto-selected if it’s the only valid choice.

- **Residual Entries in Deployer DB After Delete**  
  Ensured cluster metadata is fully removed from the deployer database on datastore deletion.

- **Vulnerable JS Library & Missing SRI**  
  Updated front-end dependencies and added Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks for external scripts.

- **CloudStack Add Volume Panic**  
  Added safer logic when tagging or attaching volumes in CloudStack to prevent nil-pointer panics.

- **Excessive Node Creation**  
  Fixed a reconciliation bug that occasionally spawned more nodes than requested.

- **IOPS Charts Unit Label**  
  Changed misleading “p/s” label to “IOPS” for disk throughput metrics.

- **Resource Cleanup on Network Failures**  
  Improved rollback/cleanup steps when adding a node fails due to a dropped cloud connection.

- **Missing Backup Sub-Tab**  
  Restored the sub-tab that displays the name/details of each configured backup.

- **Legacy DB Parameter View Default Values**  
  Corrected a UI bug that always showed the default value instead of the currently applied value.

- **Removing a Node with an Active Backup Schedule**  
  No longer deletes the entire schedule; scheduling is adjusted to “auto” if the chosen replica is removed.

- **Parameter Group Sync Always “Pending”**  
  Fixed the logic so the sync status properly reflects “success,” “failed,” or “pending.”

- **Intermittent PANIC Alerts**  
  Added guards and logging improvements to handle unexpected corner cases more gracefully.

- **Incomplete `sql_mode` Defaults for MySQL/MariaDB**  
  Updated default and allowed `sql_mode` values for MySQL 8, MariaDB 10.11, and 11.4 to match upstream documentation.
