# Upgrading CCX to be production ready

:::danger
At this point, it's presumed that you have already installed CCX following the tutorial. In case that you wish to upgrade it to be production ready, isntead of creating everything from scratch, this page will show you how to do so. Just before doing so, make sure you have adequate resources at your disposal to do so.
::::

:::note
Make sure that you have at least 300Gi of storage capacity for the upgrade. The actual size will depend on your need for the retention policy of metrics and logs.
:::

### Ingress Controller

At this point, it's presumed that ingress controller is properly deployed, as well as that you have externally facing load balancers.

To be production ready, we will need to add a couple of headers, as well as change a couple of configuration parameters. Depending on how you deployed the ingress controler, you will need to do the following:

If you installed ingress controller with the `helm chart` and you are in control of it's `values file`, you will need to add the follwing configuration to it and redeploy the helm cart:

```
  controller:
    addHeaders:
      Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
      X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
      X-Frame-Options: DENY
      X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    config:
      allow-backend-server-header: "true"
      use-forwarded-headers: "true"
      hide-headers: "Server,X-Powered-By"
```

If you don't have control over the ingress controler values (e.x. controler comes up installed in cluster upon boot), do the follwoing:

Create new ConfigMap that contains the following:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx-custom-add-headers
  namespace: ingress-nginx
data:
  X-Frame-Options: "DENY"
  X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"
  X-XSS-Protection: "1; mode=block"
  Referrer-Policy: "no-referrer"
  Content-Security-Policy: "default-src 'self';"
```
Once applied, find the configuration map that contains configuration for the ingress controller. 
`kubectl get configmap -n nginx-ingress-controller`
Edit the ConfigMap so that in contains the following configurations:

```
allow-backend-server-header: "true"
use-forwarded-headers: "true"
hide-headers: "Server,X-Powered-By"
add-headers: "nginx-ingress-controller/ingress-nginx-custom-add-headers"
```
:::note
Make sure that add-headers field matches the path of the previously generated configuration map for headers. First part is namespace, second is the ConfigMap name.
:::

Once this is done, restart all of the nginx pods in order for them to pick up new configurations.

### Cert Manager

When setting up production version of cert-manager, there are a few configurtations parameter that needs to be adressed:
`replicaCount` - by default it's set to 1. To make sure it's production ready, make sure it has 2 or 3 replicas to provide high availability.
`podDisruptionBudget.enabled` - by default this is set to `false`. Make sure to change it to `true` if you changed `replicaCount` to be different than 1. 
`crds.enabled` - set to `true`. This will make sure to install all of the CRD's needed for optimal work. 
`crds.keep` - make sure it's set to `true`. This will prevent Helm from uninstalling the CRD when the Helm release is uninstalled.

Depending on how you wish to use this instance of `cert-manager`, make sure that `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` exists and is configured properly.


### Dependencies update

Originaly the `ccxdeps` helm chart was installed in tutorial using the default values. Create a new file called `ccxdeps.yaml`. You can use te values below and modify them per your needs.

```
mysql-innodbcluster:
  serverInstances: 3 # This is something you can chose, but it can only be 1,3,5,7 or 9.
  podSpec: #whaever is set under podSpec can't be changed in future, so take care in using correct settings
    containers:
    - name: mysql
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "2048Mi" #make sure this is set properly
victoria-metrics-alert:
  enabled: true
victoria-metrics-single:
  enabled: true
ccx-monitoring:
  alertmanager:
    enabled: false
  enabled: true
  loki:
    gateway:
      ingress:
        hosts:
        - host: some-loki-domain.com
          paths:
          - path: /loki
            pathType: Prefix
        tls:
        - hosts:
          - some-loki-domain.com
          secretName: loki-gateway-tls
    loki_host_url: some-loki-domain.com
oracle-mysql-operator:
  enabled: true
installOperators: true
```
Please take a look at all [values](https://github.com/severalnines/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/ccxdeps/values.yaml), as you might be interested in some of the additional flags.

To upgrade the chart, use the following command:
```
helm upgrade --install ccxdeps s9s/ccxdeps --debug --wait -n ccx -f ccxdeps.yaml
```

### Configuring Cloud Credentials in K8s Secrets

Configure the credentials to use your project you made for production. If the previously created ones are fine, you can proceed to next step. 

## Add the email configuration

In oder to setup the emailing for the ccx, create the secret in accordance to the following template:
```
apiVersion: v1
data:
  SMTP_FROM:  #email adress from which emails will be sent
  SMTP_FROM_NAME: CCX
  SMTP_HOST: #sender host
  SMTP_PASSWORD: #email password
  SMTP_PORT: #port
  SMTP_USERNAME: #username
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: smtp
  namespace: ccx
type: Opaque
```

Use `kubectl apply -f smtp.yaml` to apply the secret.

More documentation can be found [here.](../Day2/Notifications.md)


### Security Group ccx-common

ccx-common` must allow all TCP traffic from all k8s nodes where CCX is running. 

The Egress must also be allowed. Below is a screenshot showing the `ccx-common`. The EXTERNAL-IP is specified for the port range 1-65535.

:::important
If you have three worker nodes, and they have different IP addresses then you must add three entries to the security group, allowing 1-65535 for each IP address as egress.
:::

### OpenStack CCX Value File


:::note
A number of identifiers are case sensitive: `ccx.config.clouds[].regions[].code`, `ccx.config.clouds[].regions[].availabiliity_zones[].code`, `ccx.services.deployer.config.openstack_vendors[].regions[].identifier` and also the codes for the `instance_types`, `flavors`, `volumes` are `network_types` case-sensitive. Be consistent!
:::

At this point, ccx should be deployed with minimal values yaml. The following values.yaml is minimal for production evnironment:

:::

```yaml
cc:
  cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 #setup according to your network
ccFQDN: cc.ccx.somedomain.com # dns name for ccx

There might be more stuff that needs to be added/changed, but that will depend on your infrastructure.

To upgrade ccx helm chart, run the following command:
```
helm upgrade --install ccx s9s/ccx -n ccx --debug --wait -f openstack.yaml
```

Once done, `https://ccx.somedomain.com/auth/register?from=ccx` in a web browser, register a new user and verify that datastore creatin is working properly.
