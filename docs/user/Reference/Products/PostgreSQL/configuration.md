## Important default values
| Parameter        | Default value           | Comment  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| wal_keep_size | 1024 (v.1.50+) / 512 |
| max_wal_senders | min 16, max 4 x Db Node count||
| wal_level | replica ||
| hot_standby |  ON |  |
| max_connections | see below | |
| shared_buffers | instance_memory x 0.25 | |
| effective_cache_size | instance_memory x 0.75 | |
| work_mem | instance_memory / max_connections | |
| maintenance_work_mem | instance_memory/16 | |

### Max connections
The maximum number of connections depends on the instance size.
The number of connections can be scaled by adding a new database secondary allowing of a larger instance size. The new replica can then be promoted to the new primary. See [Promoting a replica](../../../Howto/Promote-a-replica.md) for more information.
| Instance size (GiB RAM)       | Max connections |
| ------------- |-------------|
| < 4 | 100 |
| 8 | 200 |
| 16 | 400 |
| 32 | 800 |
| 64+ | 1000 |
