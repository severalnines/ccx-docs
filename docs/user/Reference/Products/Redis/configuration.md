# Configuration

## Volume size

Since Redis is an in-memory database, the storage size is fixed and twice the amount of the RAM. Thus, it is not possible to:

- specify the storage size in the deployment wizard.
- scale the storage.

## Persistance

Redis is configured to use both AOF and RDB for persistance.
The following configuration parameters are set:

- appendonly yes
- default values for AOF
- default values for RDB
